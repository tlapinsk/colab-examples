# Colab Examples
This repository will hold neural networks trained in [Google Colab notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true).

It serves as a side project as I don't have much exposure to Machine Learning or Deep Learning at work. I'll continue filling out the README as this repository grows.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out at tim.lapinskas@gmail.com. 

P.S. I am also looking for a job :) so do reach out!
